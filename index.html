          <p>Hosting Conclave at the Youngstown Air Reserve Station, we can look forward to many unique opportunities and activities never before seen at a Conclave. It is weekends like this Conclave, where you can try new things with your Brothers, that lead to the creation of memories that last a lifetime.</p>
          <p>Speaking of Brotherhood, with each of the six lodges in our section gathering for this event, you will be able to meet other Arrowmen just like you from all over Eastern Ohio and parts of West Virginia.</p>
          <p>I invite you to join me on this amazing adventure!</p>

            <p>Ample signage will guide travelers in from State Route 11.</p>
            <p>All persons attending Conclave must be listed on the Entry Authorization List (EAL). All Arrowmen registered will be added to the list. Others who need access should <a href="#" rel="contactus">contact us</a>.</p>
            <h3>Driving and staying with us</h3>
            <p>Arrowmen on the EAL should drive directly to the main gate at the Youngstown Air Reserve Station. Their identity will be confirmed, and then they will be provided access to the base. Once inside, service lodge personnel will direct you to the check-in location.</p>
            <h3>Drop-off</h3>
            <p>Arrowmen who are being dropped off at the event should proceed to the visitor center parking lot outside of the main gate. During limited hours service lodge personnel will provide a shuttle to the check-in location on the base. Hours will be published as the event nears. Outside of shuttle hours, Arrowmen will need to walk from the main gate to the designated check-in area.</p>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <p>Driving directions to the main gate area are available by using the map to the right. Fill in your starting point's address, click the "Route" button, and your directions will be displayed below the map. In order to customize or print your directions, click the link beneath them to view the route on MapQuest.</p>

            <p>Dear Parents,</p>
            <p>Congratulations on your son’s membership in the Order of the Arrow (OA). His election shows that the other members of his Boy Scout troop felt he exhibited Scouting’s principles and would give cheerful service to others. As you may know, most of the OA events in which your son will participate will take place locally with the OA lodge. Once each year, the six lodges in Northeast Ohio and Northern West Virginia (called a “section” or “Section C-4A”) gather for a fun-filled weekend called “Conclave.”</p>
            <p>The 2015 C-4A Conclave will be held the weekend of May 15-17 at Youngstown Air Reserve Station (Vienna, OH), and is expected to be attended by over 225 Arrowmen from across our Section.</p>
            <p>If your son has expressed an interest in attending the 2015 C-4A Conclave, consider allowing him to attend. Conclave is the premier event for both youth and adults and one of the highlights of the OA year!  Conclave is a full weekend of activities and experiences designed to take Scouting to the next level for your son. A large group of Arrowmen from your local area will likely travel to Conclave together. When you complete the online registration process to sign-up for Conclave, you can indicate if your son needs a ride to Conclave and he will be contacted by someone from his local lodge to make those arrangements.</p>
            <p>During the Conclave weekend, your son will experience specialized leadership training, learn more about the Order of the Arrow, have the opportunity to participate in friendly competitions, and have a lot of fun!  This year, Conclave participants will also have the unique opportunity of exploring the Air Base and all it has to offer.</p>
            <p>As you can see, the 2015 Conclave will be an action-packed and fulfilling event, just like it has been for more than fifty years. Your son is sure to have a fantastic weekend and grow as an individual and leader. He will have the chance to make new friends his age from across Ohio and West Virginia and make memories that will last a lifetime. We hope you will consider permitting your son to enjoy the 2015 C-4A Conclave. If you have any further questions about Conclave, be sure to visit the <a href="#faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a> segment of this website or feel free to <a href="#" rel="contactus">contact us.</a></p>

            <p>This year at Conclave, we've got more training than we even know what to do with! Seriously though, we've reworked the schedule a bit to fit in even more excellent content for this year. First off, with the new Brotherhood ceremony being released, we're offering a comprehensive, intensive workshop for ceremonialists, inductions officers, and advisers from across the section with our <a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target=".training-1-modal">New Brotherhood Workshop</a>, spanning both training periods and including a special lunch session. That's not the only special lunch session this year though - everyone is invited to choose a new "lunch and learn" session tuned to their interests. You can see some of the great options we have below.</p>

              <dd id="housing-faq1" class="collapse">
                <p>Participants under 18 that are not staying in lodging with their parent or guardian will be housed in an assigned space within a building at the Youngstown Air Reserve Station.  Based on availability, it is anticipated that this housing will primarily fall within the gym at the recreation center.  Showers will be available.  It would be acceptable to bring a cot to sleep on rather than on the floor.  While the space will be divided to follow youth protection guidelines, there are no other dividers anticipated.  Cots should be placed on a mat or have rubber feet in order to protect the floor on which they’re placed.</p>
                <p>Those 18 years of age or older can also choose the included option described above or they can upgrade to the on base Eagle’s Nest Lodge (hotel) for an additional fee provided there is availability.  Arrowmen under 18 may stay in a hotel room with their parent or guardian.</p>

If the room isn’t confirmed within a week it will be released back to the available inventory and the requester will be assigned included housing.</p></dd>

Suites and double rooms have a limit of four people.  Queen rooms are limited at two.  One person will need to make the reservation and be the ‘owner’ of the room.  He/she can add additional registered guests after confirming the hotel with the base.  The email address of the person being added will need to be entered.  The newly added guest will receive an email to confirm the switch from included housing to a hotel room.  The ‘owner’ of the room must arrive before the guests will obtain access to the room. We make no assumptions about your preferred lodging arrangements; the roommate invitation procedure will need to be followed, even for adding family members.</p></dd>

We will also ask for your estimated time of arrival, estimated to the nearest half-hour, which helps us plan for the crowd and ensure we know not to consider you a no-show if you're getting in late.</p>
                <p>Finally, we will ask your plans for lodging, transportation, and training. There are a few important notes about these selections. Please read the <a href="#housing">housing details</a> to better understand the housing choices.</p>
                <p>We will ask whether you are being dropped off, driving yourself, or riding with another driver to Conclave. These options will help us ensure adequate parking and permission for the vehicles that will be on base during Conclave. We will also offer the option of a coordinated carpool ride, where we will attempt to match you up with a driver from your lodge to get you to Conclave. This is not a guarantee of a ride, but we will do our best to fill every seat we have available from our volunteer drivers. We will confirm your ride and driver to you and provide contact information if we are able to match you with someone. If you choose the coordinated carpool, until you recieve a confirmation email, <em>you do not have a carpool ride</em> and you should keep alternate plans available.</p>

            <h3>Important Housing Information</h3>
            <p>We will offer multiple options for your lodging choice. The first option – 'included housing' – will be a space within a building on the Air Force base.  Based on availability, we anticipate most will be housed in the recreation center.  There will be access to showers.  If this option is selected, it would be acceptable to bring a cot to Conclave rather than sleeping on the floor.  Cots should be placed on a mat or have rubber feet in order to protect the floor on which they’re placed.</p>
            <p>We will also offer the option to select a room within the Eagle’s Nest Lodge.  This option is based on availability.  The room inventory displayed in the registration system is accurate as of the time of registration.  Suites are available for $69 per night (no tax) and rooms with either a queen bed or two double beds are available for $60 per night (no tax).  Payment will be arranged through the Air Force.  If this option is selected, an email will be sent with details on confirming your tentative hold on a room.  Reservations will be required to be confirmed with a credit card within a week of email receipt, at which point you may be reassigned to 'included' housing automatically and your room released for someone else to reserve.</p>
            <p>If you want to be added as a roommate to someone else's hotel room, the system will instruct you to choose 'included housing' as your lodging preference. This is important to ensure that you are considered to be available to be a roommate and that on the off-chance the room is already full, you won't be without a place to sleep. Arrowmen 18 years of age or older can be added to a confirmed room through the registration system.  Arrowmen under 18 may stay be added to a room reserved by their parent or guardian.  In order to stay in the hotel, it MUST be confirmed by the registration system. Suites and double rooms can accommodate 4 guests.  Queen rooms can accommodate 2 guests.  To be added to a room, the registered email address of the guest in question must be known.  The person that reserved the room can add guest(s) by entering the guest’s email address in the roommate invitation form, which will be available only <strong>after</strong> the room is confirmed as reserved. The guest being added will receive an email asking them to accept or deny the invitation to be a roommate.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>The general welfare of any group depends upon the conduct of each individual member. This Code of Conduct ensures the success of our Conclave and provides the maximum benefit to every participant. The Conclave leadership is responsible for the supervision of the event in respect to maintaining discipline and security, and every participant must agree to the following Code of Conduct:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Observe the Scout Oath or Promise, the Scout Law and the Order of the Arrow Obligation.  Follow the policies of the Boy Scouts of America including Youth Protection and Social Media.  Adhere to directions given by base personnel or conclave leadership.</li>
              <li>Dress, according to the schedule, in either field uniform (Class A) or activity uniform (Class B) through the entire event.  Wear the provided Conclave credential (name badge) when out of assigned housing area.</li>
              <li>The use of tobacco in any form, alcoholic beverages, illicit drugs, weapons of any kind including laser pointers, firearms, fireworks, or gambling is strictly prohibited.</li>
              <li>Participants and staff will be actively engaged in the Conclave program. </li>
              <li>Participants will be personally liable for any breakage, damage or loss of property.  </li>
              <li>Participants must sleep in their designated housing area. Everyone must observe curfew and lights-out rules, and keep their sleeping area clean and tidy.  The lodging (hotel) rooms may only be reserved by Arrowmen eighteen years of age or older.  At no time should a standard room contain more than four people.</li>
              <li>Participants are not authorized to sell items at the event. The official trading posts (including the shoppette) are the only source for purchasing items at the event aside from lodge operated trading posts in assigned areas.</li>
              <li>Every participant must comply with all laws, as well as any special rules or regulations of the Youngstown Air Reserve Station, such as staying away from restricted and controlled areas.</li>
              <li>Once a car is parked for the event, it must remain in the designated parking lot until departure unless a driving pass has been issued by the Section Adviser or Conclave Service Lodge Adviser.</li>
              <li>Youngstown Air Reserve Station is a working military installation.  Do not enter or disturb areas that are not explicitly defined in the Conclave program guide.  There will be others on base during our visit, so it is of utmost importance that we respect their space and property.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The lodge adviser or contingent leader will approve the corrective measures for a violation of these rules before being implemented. Corrective measures will be at the discretion of the Conclave leadership, which may include dismissal from Conclave.  The previous statement does not preclude the security forces of the Youngstown Air Reserve Station from taking action without intervention from Order of the Arrow leadership which may include dismissal from the base.</p>
